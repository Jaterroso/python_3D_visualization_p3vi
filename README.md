# Python 3D Visualization (p3vi) project

Welcome to the "Python 3D Visualization" (p3vi) project. Similarly to the "Python 2D Graph" (p2go) project, it is a hackable, step-by-step for visualizing a 3D graph Python-object.

I classify the "p3vi" as a "sandbox" or "toy" project. In other words, it is a fun, experimental project focusing on solving one problem.

We learned using graph-paper to draw linear algebra equations in Jr. High school, and to some extent, a 3D graph of cubes and cones. In math, we learned to work with 3, 4, n-th dimensions arrays. Therefore, I thought I have adequate working knowledge of spatial acuity.

But I was wrong. Tracing an arbitrary line in a 3D graph, using the "x, y and z" coordinate, is not simple. It is not simple for me. There are plenty of Python libraries that draw commonly used 3D charts to visualize extensive data set, such as terrain graph or weather formation. Still, none enable me to draw an arbitrary 3D line, not from the linear equation, or visualize my far-fetched ideas of graphing NLP data in 3D or finding 3D-patterns in image categorization.

As with the "p2go" project, why not do it yourself? I earnestly believe in strengthen original-thinking over memorizing terminology. It is wise to learn from others, but why stop there? Your wild hunches are as significant as the great discoveries in their early stage.
